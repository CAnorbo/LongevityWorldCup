        <p>Acquire a 2025 blood test from which we can compute your biological age, called PhenoAge. You need the following biomarkers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Albumin</strong> (also known as Serum Albumin)</li>
            <li><strong>Creatinine</strong> (sometimes called Serum Creatinine)</li>
            <li><strong>Glucose</strong> (also referred to as Blood Sugar)</li>
            <li><strong>C-Reactive Protein</strong> (CRP, also known as hs-CRP for high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein)</li>
            <li><strong>Lymphocyte Percentage</strong> (may be labeled as Lymphocyte % or Absolute Lymphocyte Count)</li>
            <li><strong>Mean Corpuscular Volume</strong> (MCV, also called Average Red Blood Cell Size)</li>
            <li><strong>Red Cell Distribution Width</strong> (RDW, sometimes called RDW-CV or Red Blood Cell Size Variation)</li>
            <li><strong>Alkaline Phosphatase</strong> (ALP, also referred to as Alk Phos)</li>
            <li><strong>White Blood Cell Count</strong> (WBC Count, also called Leukocyte Count)</li>
